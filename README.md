- **Local Storage**: The app uses local storage to save tasks, ensuring that the tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
- **Task Descriptions**: Users can add detailed descriptions to each task.
- **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can be prioritized as Low, Medium, or High, which are visually distinguished by different colors.
- **Due Dates**: Users can set a due date for each task, and the app displays tasks accordingly.
